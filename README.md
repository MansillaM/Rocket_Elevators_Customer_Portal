# Rocket_Elevators_Customer_Portal

Welcome to my portal for Rocket Elevator Customers.

To log in you will need one of these emails
  -sharen_connelly@howell.com
  -tracee@pacocha-towne.io
  -janna.hayes@funk-labadie.co
  -lady@ritchie.com
  -lorenzo_medhurst@kirlin.biz
  
 For every email the password is : Allo123!
 
 Only when you will be logged in will you be able to access the Intervention Page and the Product Management page.
 
 To populate the Interventions fields I used jQuery ajax calls to asynchronously change the the data depending on which ID you pick.
 
 To populate the Product Managements fields I also used jQuery ajax calls but this time to show all the data from the logged in user.
 
 All the work was done on the DotNet MVC framework.
 
 For the ajax endpoints I used another project specially made for these calls you can have a look here ==> https://github.com/MansillaM/Rocket-Elevators-Foundation2
